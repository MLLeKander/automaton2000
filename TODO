* Road plan
The plan is to first port the code to Python 3.4.2, and start writing
unit tests.

Once the core has decent coverage, I want to start working
on a better module architecture. OMGTallMonster mentioned turning each
module into an actor and communicating over queues. This inherently
means turning modules into classes, which is needed either way.

The next step is permanent storage. The API still needs to be
designed, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Once we have a storage API and a sane module API, we can start
implementing more interesting modules.

A few that have been mentioned:

- A help module that allows modules to self-document, and users to
  query this documentation.
- A URL shortener.
- A fuck9gag module that detects links to 9gag and replaces them by
  fuck9gag links.
- Triggered text storage, that allows storage and retrieval by keyword
  in IRC.
- Authorization, so the bot can handle non-public operations.

* Python 3
Read [[http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html][this]] for notes on why we would want to move to Python 3. tl;dr:
Python 3 is all about getting unicode right, and barring specific
reasons, I think we should move ahead.
